erlcloud: Cloud Computing APIs For Erlang

This is version 0.2.0.  The API is subject to change.

Currently, this library implements the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) API,
version 2009-11-30. All API functions have been implemented.  Not all functions
have been tested, so exercise care when integrating this library into
production code.  Please send bug reports and patches.

This library also implements the Amazon SimpleDB API, version 2009-04-15.  All API
functions have undergone basic testing, but not under real-world conditions.  This
is still alpha software.

The library can be used two ways: either you can specify configuration
parameters in the process dictionary, or you can create a configuration object
and pass that to each request as the final parameter.

Getting started
---------------

If you're using erlcloud in your applicaiton, add it as a dependency
in your application's configuration file.  To use erlcloud in the shell,
you can ensure that all its dependencies have been started by calling:

> erlcloud:start().


Per-process configuration:

> erlcloud_ec2:configure(AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey [, Hostname])

Hostname defaults to "ec2.amazonaws.com".

Then you can simply call, e.g. erlcloud_ec2:describe_images().

You don't need to call erlcloud_ec2:configure() if you provide your credentials
in the AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environmental
variables.



Configuration object usage:

> EC2 = erlcloud_ec2:new(AccessKeyId, SecretAccessKey [, Hostname])

> erlcloud_ec2:describe_images(EC2).


For usage information, consult the source code and refer to the EC2 API reference at:
